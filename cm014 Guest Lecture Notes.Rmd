### Nested model: Four levels of vis design

-domain situation
  - who are the target user
-abstraction
-idiom
  - how it is shown?
  
### Why is validation difficult?
- Solution: use methods from different fields at each level
- Domain situation - observe target users using existing tools
- Date/task abstraction
- Visual encoding/interaction idiom - justify design with respect to alternatives
- Algorithm - Meansure system time/memory, analyze computational complexity
- Analyze results qualitatively - Measure human time with lab experiment (lab study)
- Observe target users after depolyment (field study)
- Measure adoption
